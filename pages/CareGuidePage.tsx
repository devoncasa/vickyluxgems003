                            Burmese amber, or Burmite, is a precious organic gemstone that requires special care to maintain its natural beauty and integrity. Unlike harder mineral gemstones, amber is soft and can be susceptible to damage if not handled correctly. Follow these guidelines to ensure your amber jewelry remains a timeless treasure for generations to come.

                                Use a soft, lint-free cloth (like a microfiber or flannel cloth) dampened with lukewarm water to gently wipe your amber jewelry. This is usually sufficient to remove dust and oils.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For more stubborn grime, you can use a mild, non-detergent soap mixed with lukewarm water. Rinse thoroughly with clean water and dry immediately with a soft cloth.

                                Never use chemical cleaners, detergents, or ultrasonic cleaners on your amber jewelry. These can dull the surface and cause irreversible damage.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                Remove your amber jewelry before applying perfume, hairspray, lotions, or sunscreen. The chemicals in these products can create a white coating on the amber that is difficult to remove.

                                Amber is relatively soft (about 2.0-2.5 on the Mohs hardness scale), so it can be easily scratched by harder materials.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                Store your amber jewelry separately from other jewelry, especially pieces with metal settings or harder gemstones like diamonds or sapphires. A soft pouch or a fabric-lined jewelry box is ideal.
                            </p>

                                Prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can cause amber to darken over time and may lead to brittleness.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                Sudden temperature changes can also cause stress fractures. Avoid leaving your amber jewelry in a hot car or in direct sunlight for extended periods.
                            </p>

                                Over time, amber may lose some of its luster due to contact with skin and the environment. You can restore its shine by gently rubbing it with a small amount of olive oil on a soft cloth, then polishing it with a clean, dry cloth to remove any excess oil.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                For deeper scratches or significant dullness, it is best to consult a professional jeweler who has experience with amber.

                            While amber is durable enough for everyday wear, it's best to remove it before engaging in strenuous activities, such as sports, gardening, or heavy lifting, to prevent impact damage.
