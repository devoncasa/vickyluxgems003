                        <div className="space-y-4">
                            <p>
                                Begin by contacting us with your design idea, inspiration, or specific requirements. You can use our "Build Your Pre-Order" tool to explore options or reach out to us directly for a more personalized consultation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We will discuss your preferences for amber color, bead size, quality grade, and any additional features such as metal caps or amulets. Our team will provide expert guidance to help you make informed choices.

                        <h2>Step 2: Quotation and Deposit</h2>
                        <SectionDivider/>
                        <div className="space-y-4">
                            <p>
                                Based on your requirements, we will provide you with a detailed price quotation outlining the cost of materials and craftsmanship. This quotation is transparent and free of hidden fees.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To proceed with the pre-order, a non-refundable deposit of 50% of the total price is required. This deposit secures the materials for your piece and confirms your commitment to the custom order.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                           <p>
                                Once the deposit is confirmed, our skilled artisans will begin crafting your custom piece. We take great care in selecting and shaping each bead to meet our high standards of quality.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                Production time typically ranges from 2–4 weeks, depending on the complexity of the design and the availability of specific materials. We will keep you updated on the progress of your order.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <h2>Step 4: Final Payment and Shipping</h2>
                        <SectionDivider/>

                           <p>
                               Upon completion, we will notify you and provide photos of the finished product for your approval. We want to ensure you are completely satisfied before we proceed.
                            </p>
                             <p>
                                The remaining 50% balance is due before shipping. Once the final payment is received, your order will be carefully packaged, fully insured, and shipped to you with tracking information provided.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                Due to the custom nature of pre-orders, the initial 50% deposit is non-refundable once production has begun. This is because materials are specifically sourced and cut for your unique piece.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Any changes to the design after the deposit has been paid may be subject to additional charges and may extend the production timeline. We will discuss any potential costs with you before proceeding with changes.
