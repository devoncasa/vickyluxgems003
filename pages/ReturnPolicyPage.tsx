                            <p>Burmese amber has the unique ability to absorb the natural oils and fumes of its owner, making each piece deeply personal. Over time, it attunes to the energy and essence of the individual who wears it.</p>
                            <p>Because of this intimate characteristic, exchanging ownership of Burmese amber jewelry is not suitable. This principle is similar to clothing that has been worn; it can no longer be considered new or untouched. When choosing Burmese amber jewelry, it is important to keep in mind that it will become a unique piece, specific to you.</p>
